# Hello and welcome to the pntreliability repository!
last updated: 5/20/2024

This is a repository of materials supporting a submitted manuscript, 'How reliably do clinicians classify paraphasias?' This repository is currently archived as a means of sharing the files with the public in a read-only format. However, it is still actively maintained. Any questions concerning the analyses or code can be sent to: marianne.e.casilio@vanderbilt.edu. 

To use materials in this repository, we ask that future authors cite the following:

Casilio, M., Fleegle, M., Bedrick, S., & Fergadiotis, G. (submitted). How reliably do clinicians classify paraphasias?

# Data
The zip file data.zip contains four data files for replicating analyses reported in the manuscript:

**pntreliability.txt**

This is the master file containing all error codes across for the 25 clinician raters who participated in the study. This file is most useful for replicating the agreement metrics using Krippendorff's alpha but could also be used for secondary analyses or for replicating the study itself. Error code abbreviations are as follows: AN = Abstruse neologism, F = Formal, M = Mixed, N = Neologism, O = Other, S = Semantic

**proportion_lexicaljudgments.txt**

**proportion_phonologicaljudgments.txt**

**proportion_semanticjudgments.txt**

These are files that transform the data from the master file (pntreliability.txt) into the proportion of judgments along a given dimension, for all responses nested within a participant, for each of the 25 clinican raters in the study. These files are most useful for replicating agreement metrics using intraclass correlation coefficients.

# Training
Included in the training.zip file is all of the materials we created to train the clinician raters in the paraphasia classification scheme of the Philadelphia Naming Test (PNT; Roach et al., 1996). In some cases, similar materials are also available at https://mrri.org/philadelphia-naming-test/. The picture stimuli for the PNT can also be found at this URL. Finally, we have not included the book chapter that was an assigned reading as part of the training program but have included the citation here for those who may be interested:

Martin, N. (2013). Disorders of word production. Aphasia and related neurogenic communication disorders, 131-155.

**instructions.docx**

This is a document outlining all of the steps to completing the training and coding phases of the study. Information specific to the particular study, such as email addresses and folder names, was removed with instructions in [ ] on what to add should this document be used in future studies. 

**training.pptx**

This is a scripted and audio-narrated powerpoint presentation that provides an in-depth overview to the PNT's classification system.

**codingcheatsheet.pdf**

This is a two-page handout that includes a flowchart of the PNT's classification system, as well as guidelines on how to make the lexical, phonological, and semantic judgments necessary to arriving at a given paraphasia code.

**transcriptionconventions.docx**

This document includes a list of conventions used for transcribing responses on the PNT. 

**targettranscriptions.docx**

This document includes a phonemic transcription of the PNT's 175 target items.

**practicefileexample.xlsx**

This file shows how data was presented to the clinician raters when classifying paraphasias during the study.

**worklog.docx**

This document is a log that was used for tracking clinician raters' progress throughout the study.

# Clinical resources
We have included individual files for each of the four clinical resources that were provided as incentives for the present study. Each is a scripted and audio-recorded powerpoint presentation on topics relevant to the study.

**clinicalresource1.pptx**

This resource goes over the usefulness of picture naming as a task for assessing language performance in those with aphasia.

**clinicalresource2.pptx**

This resource goes over the theory behind why individuals with aphasia produce paraphasias and how to interpret them within a common theoretical framework.

**clinicalresource3.pptx**

This resource goes over how to use psycholinguistic variables (e.g., lexical frequency) in aphasia assessment.

**clinicalresource4.pptx**

This resource goes over how to score non-paraphasic responses produced on the PNT.
